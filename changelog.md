# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 2.0.0
- typecheck: allow user to pass in options for [`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin#options)
- typecheck: #22: remove `alwaysCheck`, allow user to simply set `typeCheck` to enable / disable type checking completely. Previous behavior can be preserved by setting the following options in `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-ts',
  options: {
    // Disable type checking in production
    typeCheck: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  }
}
```

## 1.3.3
- fix #15 where empty documents break build; display warning instead of throwing error
